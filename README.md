## Run Locally

Below are the instructions on how to run project locally:

Preconditions:
1. Install NVM ([windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows), [linux / macos](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))

```bash
# Switch to correct node version
nvm install
nvm use
# Install pnpm - https://pnpm.io/
npm install -g pnpm
# Clone the project
git clone <gitlab-project-link>
# Go to the project directory
cd <project-folder>
# Install all dependencies
pnpm i
# Start the server in dev mode
pnpm dev
```

## Technical stack

1. [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - SSR React.js framework.
2. [Vanilla Extract CSS](https://vanilla-extract.style/) - Lib for writing styles.
3. [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/) - State management lib.
4. [clsx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clsx) - Combinator for class names.

### Components folder

Folder `/src/components` is divided to few folders. Take a look at the main idea of this folders:

| Priority | Folder               | Idea                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | /src/components/sections | Usually each page is built from sections. So this folder contains sections for each page. SECTION - it is components taking full width of device.                                                           |
| 2        | /src/components/blocks   | Blocks are reusable components, used inside in sections. Main difference between Block and Section - Block can't take full width of page.                                                                   |
| 3        | /src/components/common   | This components could be used everywhere. By other words, components in this folder could be named as UI Kit of project. Any change in this folder **have to be documented via storybook**. |

## Code style

-   [TSX](./README/jsx-codestyle.md)

## Documentation

Some of project components are covered by `storybook. To open project docs do the following:

```bash
pnpm sb:dev # Starts locally OR
pnpm sb:build # Make static build
```

This command will open storybook on you local machine. Read more about `storybook` at [official documentation](https://storybook.js.org/docs/get-started/whats-a-story).

## Prettier and Pre-commit (lint-staged)

When any developer finished his work, he **commits** files and `lint-staged` package runs commands before making a commit.

It is run ONLY for **STAGED** files. So do not be worried to make commits.

```js
// Check TS files for no errors
	'**/*.(ts|tsx)': () => 'pnpm tsc --noEmit',

// Lint and format TS and JS files
'**/*.(ts|tsx|js)': (filenames) => [
    `pnpm eslint --fix ${filenames.join(' ')}`,
    `pnpm prettier --write ${filenames.join(' ')}`,
],
```

## Branch naming

Format of branch names:

> PROJ-{task-number}-{short-description}

Examples:

-   `PROJ-821-fix-bug` - if task exists when branch created
-   `NOTASK-update-deps` - if task do not exists when branch created

## Commit naming

Format of commit messages:

> PROJ-{task-number}: What has been done

Examples:

-   `PROJ-872: Update mobx to 0.1.2`
-   `PROJ-324: Added shift and debugVideoPos. Upd docs`
-   `NOTASK: Logging into chat`

## Git flow

We work in sprints. So git flow adjusted for sprint logic.

Graph:
![git graph](README/git-hub-release-flow.png)

Tips:

1. All tasks are forked from current `main`.
2. When task ready for code review - you create MR into current `main` branch.
3. If task do not pass tests, you simply fix bugs at same branch and merge it to `main` again.
4. At the end of sprint we create release branch to perform regression testing on testing stage.
5. All hot-fixed from regression testing are located on release branch.
6. After all fixed hot-fixes release branch merge to main.
